# OSDEV

Note most of this code is not orginally mine but i uses it as a stub to start coding different toy OS.
<br>
Best site to see , learn , and get good with OS development would be osdev
<br>
https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page  Great help page 

<br>

https://webchat.freenode.net/  on channel #osdev very knowledgable people aided me alot when learning to develop os and they still are very good to collaborate with from time to time.

<br>
For one to make a productive os i say go with linuxkernel.org or linus kernel project on github here https://github.com/torvalds/linux
<br>
Osdev though is equally important because learning every detail some times outways productivity. But sometimes productivity is more important then total understanding so it depends on what frame of mind your in.

Anyway uses this project as a stub to understand how to code real , 32bit protected mode , and even with a little modification long mode /64 bit mode os development. So after you are confident in all aspect of this project you should beable to write basic graphics driver programs , keyboard drives , mouse drivers, possible basic network drivers , sound drivers , HDD drivers and a basic scheduler with a basic paging/extended paging based virtual memory allocator.
<br>
You definitely need to understand asm and c program at the more advanced level/ low level from scratch basic cpu instructions , the ISA books of intel or amd ...etc
<br>
Please note i kept most of the project the same as the original guy that wrote the stub starting OS code. Yet i dont know his name or if he is even still alive.
As its been decades just trying to keep his learning objectives alive and incorporate/make people aware that osdev goes hand and hand in understanding how to code OS.
